### NOTES TO MYSELF ON DESIGN NEEDS ###
# import the right packages (pychopy, numpy, random, os, math, statistics, pandas, time)
# import modules (psychopy: visual, core, event, monitors - from psychopy.hardware import keyboard)
# ensure paths start from the same directory
# make sure psychopy version is correct ('2022.2.4')
# create escape function to be used at any point during the task
# set up window
# don't quite know yet how to exchange height setting to pixel setting so that everything looks like
# create a file to be saved (make sure to use os.sep to work on both mac and windows)
# create an empty data frame to be filled
### record stimuli shown, choices shown, choices made, RTs, timestamps, probabilities
# create objects at the beginning that will be used throughout (avoid having to type over and over)
### real vs. test, how many for the test, colors, fonts, font size, shapes, shape dimensions, shape locations
# create components (instructions, shapes, monetary values)
# read the appropriate CSVs to load the choices
### practice, static, and dynamic
### the dynamic choice set might be a little to complex to do at the moment

"""

Originally created as a project for Programming I with Dr. Sweeny: 
- Standalone cgeRDM task (cognition, gambling, and eye-tracking: Risky Monetary Decision-making) with Practice and Static trials, but without Dynamic trials or Eye-tracking
- Based on the cgeRDM task originally modified with PsychoPy Coder to work in-person, which in turn was based on Anna Rini's Honors Thesis' cgtRDM task built with PsychoPy Builder to work on online (Pavlovia)

Modified for Sophie Forcier's Honors Thesis, EDI (effort, decision-making, and interoception): 
- ediRDM Task Design(Practice, Static, and Dynamic trials with Eye-tracking)
- Part of the 1st Session (1st Phase: RDM, Ospan, Symspan, 2nd Phase: Qualtrics EDI Survey I (IUS, SNS), and 3rd Phase: Post-Study Questionnaire)
